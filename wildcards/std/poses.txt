arms crossed
she highly disapproves
she is angry
arms akimbo
kneeling like a fool
planking
tebowing
back to viewer
lying in wait
power squat
yoga pose gone wrong
slouching like she gave up
default idle animation
trying not to cry
standing like judgment
one foot on rubble
ugly crying
jumping for joy
v for victory
victory pose
crawling toward the camera
bent over backwards
stretching like a cat
hand on cheek
sulking in a corner
hiding behind hands
leaning on a sword
arms wide like a messiah
sprawled on the floor
on knees in despair
hunched over like golem
posing like a statue
floating in fetal position
back arched unnecessarily
hands clasped in prayer
peace sign near eye
mid-dance spin
head resting on knees
sitting on edge of void
arms out like wings
half-collapsed from emotion
tripping mid-stride
doing finger guns
leaning in too close
striking a pose no one asked for
smug tilt with crossed legs
leaning against nothing
hands behind back like she knows
mid-fall
caught mid-transformation
invisible chair squat
head thrown back dramatically
hugging self like no one else will
gripping at the air like something just slipped away
standing ankle-deep in metaphorical water
reaching out to nobody in particular
caught mid-revelation, regretting it instantly
dangling one shoe from toes, contemplating futility
whispering to a reflection that doesn’t answer
balancing on tiptoe for no discernible reason
clutching chest like a cheap opera hero
spinning out of control but gracefully
frozen halfway through a laugh that turned into a scream
trying to catch confetti that isn’t there
pointing accusingly at fate
collapsing against invisible pressure
brushing dust off shoulders that keep returning
leaning forward like words might physically emerge
gripping weapon like a confession
standing victorious but clearly empty inside
mid-turn, pretending the camera isn’t there
arching backward into melodrama
about to touch something sacred or very stupid
peering into pocket dimension of their own hand
fingers tangled in hair like it’s an antenna
reclining in defeat but making it fashion
gesturing at nothing as if making a point
mid-stride, haunted by realization
arms crossed to contain the void
staring skyward like the sky owes them rent
caught mid-exit, reconsidering existence
floating as if powered by bad decisions
sprinting mid-frame, one foot blurred
twisting to look back over shoulder
leaping from ledge with coat trailing
spinning hair whip like a shampoo ad gone wrong
crouched for launch, eyes locked ahead
sliding sideways into frame
ducking under invisible obstacle
reaching out as if to catch something flying by
mid-kick, balance slightly off
tossing something over shoulder without looking
landing from a jump, knees bent, impact dust
diving forward with arms stretched
swinging a weapon or umbrella in wide arc
vaulting over unseen barrier
spinning on heel to face camera
recoiling from sudden light or impact
stretching arms overhead mid-yawn
stumbling forward after tripping
dodging sideways from off-screen threat
jumping back from explosion of emotion
half-turn pause, like caught in flash
bracing against wind that doesn’t exist
pulling someone close in sudden motion
breaking into a run from stillness
reaching upward as if being lifted
twisting torso mid-dance
tumbling backward with zero dignity
hand out, calling someone to follow
catching balance on one foot
mid-spin with fabric flaring
sliding to a stop on knees
