in the distance, lanterns flicker through the ruins of a graveyard  
beyond her, a crooked manor looms behind twisted trees  
far below, mist curls around cracked tombstones  
on the horizon, a harvest moon bleeds into drifting clouds  
behind her, scarecrows sway in the windless dark  
through the fog, faint candles burn in forgotten windows  
far away, a church bell tolls though no one stands inside  
above, ravens wheel in silence around a leaning spire  
beneath her, roots crawl through wet soil and hollow bones  
beyond the fields, pumpkins glow like scattered embers  
at the edge of sight, a procession of ghosts drifts toward the woods  
across the marsh, pale lights shimmer over still water  
in the far distance, a bonfire crackles beneath empty gallows  
behind her, broken carriages lie half-buried in leaves  
far below, tunnels breathe with cold air and whispers  
through the haze, silhouettes hang motionless among the trees  
beyond the ridge, rotting cabins lean beneath a starless sky  
at the horizon, lightning flashes over crooked gravestones  
underfoot, damp leaves stick to cracked stone paths  
behind her, a shadow passes though no sound follows
