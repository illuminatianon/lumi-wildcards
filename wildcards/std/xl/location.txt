at the edge of a circular platform
on a cracked marble bridge
before a shattered altar
within a ring of luminous sigils
on the threshold of a broken gate
atop a spiral staircase of glass
amid the ruins of a fallen statue
on the lip of a bottomless pit
beneath a sky of fractured mirrors
at the base of a colossal obelisk
within the heart of a dead forest
on the rim of a silent crater
in the shadow of a frozen colossus
amid the wreckage of a burning airship
at the foot of an endless staircase
under the arches of a forgotten aqueduct
beside the husk of a fallen tower
floating above a sea of pale clouds
on the deck of an abandoned vessel
between pillars of living crystal
within a labyrinth of black thorns
among the roots of a titanic tree
before the gates of an ancient citadel
inside a cavern lit by molten glass
on the shore of a red moon’s reflection
amid drifting shards of shattered time
suspended over a glowing abyss
in the courtyard of a sleeping giant
beneath flickering neon conduits
in the corridor of a derelict station
on the hull of a drifting freighter
within a chamber of humming reactors
at the edge of a rusted catwalk
inside the shell of an abandoned factory
on the roof of a flooded high-rise
amid tangled power lines and smoke
before the core of a failing AI nexus
under a rain of molten sparks
at the crest of a sunlit hill
by the mouth of a crystal spring
under the canopy of golden leaves
beside a river carved through marble cliffs
within a meadow of whispering reeds
on the steps of a vine-covered terrace
at the edge of a tranquil lake
beneath a sky painted in soft auroras
among drifting petals and warm wind
before a waterfall lit by twin suns
adrift in an ocean of starlight
on the bridge between two moons
within a chamber made of memory
beneath constellations that move like clockwork
suspended in the orbit of a dying star
at the horizon of a mirrored world
in the eye of a slow-turning nebula
between the folds of a sleeping universe
on a path woven from lunar dust
before the gate of endless dawn
in the hollow of a sunken highway
amid the bones of a forgotten city
at the border of a scorched plain
within the shell of a half-buried temple
under the skeleton of a fallen airship
on the cracked surface of a desolate moon
beside a field of glass and ash
between walls painted with fading warnings
before the mouth of a wind-torn bunker
beneath the remains of a shattered world
at the center of a spiraling sigil
upon a dais of blackened stone
within a hall of chanting statues
under the light of seven eclipsed moons
on the altar of a forgotten name
amid candles that never burn out
before a mirror that breathes
in the circle where stars converge
beside a shrine of whispering masks
beneath an archway of molten gold
under a flickering streetlamp in the rain
in the alley behind a forgotten diner
on the rooftop of a crumbling tenement
beneath the sign of a dead motel
at the corner where sirens never fade
by the window of a shuttered bar
within the smoke of a midnight trainyard
on the bridge dripping with city fog
beside the rusted door of a pawn shop
under the glow of a broken billboard
in the rain-soaked mouth of an underpass
at the end of a street no one remembers
beneath the hum of old power lines
before the glass facade of an empty office tower
on the steps of a subway long out of service
among trash fires and neon ghosts
behind the fence of a condemned factory
in the reflection of an oil-slick puddle
at the base of a clock tower that never strikes
within the heartbeat of a sleepless city
