a gilded eye motif glows faintly
fractured halos orbit her head
tiny symbols shimmer across her skin
a faint sigil burns on her palm
fragments of ancient text float around her
her reflection appears in the air beside her
geometric patterns pulse beneath her feet
her shadow moves independently
cracks in space reveal shifting eyes
a thin beam of light pierces her chest like truth itself
metal feathers drift through the air
a transparent serpent coils lazily nearby
shards of glass hover, each showing a different face
a single tear turns into mercury before falling
light threads connect her to unseen constellations
the air ripples with hidden watchers
silhouetted cat figures surround her
red glowing eyes stand out
two carved pumpkins with glowing faces
red eyes glowing intensely
ink drips from the top of the frame
red eyes glowing in shadow
intricate floral textures
branches twist around circular patterns
ornate designs within the halo
triangular symbols and circular motifs in background
dark fluid-like shapes spreading on the floor
floating black orbs with blue halos
abstract ink patterns
floating eyes with lashes dripping color
swirling tendrils at feet
floating eyes with concentric circles
dripping paint effect at the top
large singular eye with pink pupil
red eye patterns in background
