  # Spatial positioning descriptors
  position:
    - in the distance
    - far away
    - beneath her
    - beyond the haze
    - high above
    - on the horizon
    - through the mist
    - behind her
    - far below
    - around her
    - ahead
    - between the clouds
    - beyond reach
    - across the void
    - just over the ridge
    - past the ruins
    - from afar
    - through the veil
    - underfoot
    - beyond the horizon
    - at the edge of sight
    - across the valley
    - in the far distance
    - beyond the ridge
    - past the mountains
    - above
    - beyond the fields
    - at the horizon
    - through the trees
    - across the plain
    - through the fog
    - beyond her

  # Surreal/fantastical scenes
  surreal:
    - colossal statues crumble into stardust
    - a shattered moon hangs low and bleeding
    - a spiral city glows with dying embers
    - fractured mirrors reflect impossible skies
    - drifting spires twist into fractal shapes
    - rivers of glass shimmer in silence
    - "a titan's silhouette dissolves into static"
    - time itself folds into silver ribbons
    - oceans of ash pulse with dim light
    - echoes of lost worlds shimmer and fade
    - bridges of bone stretch toward a hollow sun
    - phantom cities flicker and vanish
    - stars unravel like threads of smoke
    - distant monoliths hum with forgotten energy
    - shadows crawl across molten ground
    - spectral figures drift in looping patterns
    - the remnants of civilizations orbit endlessly
    - luminous symbols burn and reform
    - reflected constellations ripple across black glass
    - colors collapse into pure sound
    - a frozen sea reflects the glow of dying stars
    - cathedral-sized roots coil around broken towers
    - a clockwork city ticks beneath layers of dust
    - a storm of feathers drifts across the void
    - the sky fractures into shifting panels of memory
    - an endless bridge winds through skeletal forests
    - glass mountains hum with invisible resonance
    - inverted oceans ripple with slow thunder
    - ancient machinery stirs with hollow rhythm
    - serpentine rivers gleam with liquid light
    - floating gardens collapse into mist
    - crystalline beasts wander in silence
    - a giant eye opens within a nebula
    - luminous vines crawl over forgotten monuments
    - molten lakes cast long shadows on metallic plains
    - spectral banners ripple where armies once stood
    - the sun divides into mirrored twins
    - enormous gears turn within fractured space
    - an aurora bleeds into the ocean
    - cities of light spiral endlessly through twilight

  # Post-apocalyptic/abandoned scenes
  apocalyptic:
    - a village sinks halfway into the marsh
    - telephone poles lean through rolling fog
    - rusted train cars rest on broken tracks
    - fields of wheat sway under stormlight
    - cracked asphalt fades into tall grass
    - "collapsed bridges trace the river's path"
    - windmills turn lazily among empty hills
    - storm clouds gather, heavy and unhurried
    - puddles reflect the orange glow of lamps
    - a radio tower blinks through the rain
    - rooftops poke from shallow water
    - dust drifts around abandoned machinery
    - headlights move like ghosts along a ruined road
    - barbed wire fences cut through the mist
    - a canyon breathes with slow curling fog
    - the ruins of a factory crumble into moss
    - chimneys exhale faint columns of smoke
    - wind carries fragments of torn banners
    - gravel crunches as the light begins to fade
    - the old highway disappears into a forest of silence

  # Rural/mystical scenes
  mystical:
    - "will-o'-wisps drift above the moor"
    - a stone circle glows faintly beneath the mist
    - a river winds past cottages long abandoned
    - antlered shapes move between the trees
    - smoke rises from a hearth that should be cold
    - straw effigies sway from crooked poles
    - a thatched chapel leans toward the forest edge
    - blackbirds scatter as if warned by unseen hands
    - the earth hums with a low, steady rhythm
    - lanterns swing on the path to nowhere
    - pale figures gather where the reeds grow thick
    - bells chime though no one pulls the rope
    - a harvest pyre burns without consuming
    - the woods whisper her name in broken cadence
    - an ancient well breathes a sigh of damp air
    - a herd of deer stands perfectly still
    - candles flicker inside hollowed gourds
    - a crimson dawn creeps across moss-covered stones
    - dry leaves crackle like distant laughter
    - a path of lanterns fades one by one into dark
