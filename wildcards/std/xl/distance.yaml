  # Spatial positioning descriptors - deduplicated
  position:
    - in the distance
    - in remote reaches
    - beneath
    - high above
    - on the horizon
    - beyond the mist
    - behind
    - low in the basin
    - ahead
    - between clouds
    - beyond reach
    - across the void
    - just over the ridge
    - past the ruins
    - from afar
    - behind the veil
    - underfoot
    - at the edge of sight
    - across the valley
    - past the mountains
    - above
    - beyond the tree line
    - across the plain
    - beyond the fog bank
    - over the hill
    - past the treeline
    - where sky meets land
    - at the vanishing point
    - receding into nothing

  # Layered landforms for stronger depth bands
  terrain_layers:
    - stacked ridgelines fading one behind another
    - stepped plateaus dissolving into haze
    - overlapping dunes in alternating light and shadow
    - terraced cliffs descending toward the valley floor
