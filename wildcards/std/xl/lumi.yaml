  krampus:

    - "A decaying goat-demon whose fur teems with parasites that retreat into its flesh when disturbed. Its horns are bound with wire and parchment seals, each partially torn and leaking dark residue."
    - "A monstrous figure with a ribcage permanently spread open like a reliquary, displaying tools of punishment embedded into muscle and bone as if grown rather than carried."
