in the distance, colossal statues crumble into stardust
far away, a shattered moon hangs low and bleeding
beneath her, a spiral city glows with dying embers
beyond the haze, fractured mirrors reflect impossible skies
high above, drifting spires twist into fractal shapes
on the horizon, rivers of glass shimmer in silence
through the mist, a titan’s silhouette dissolves into static
behind her, time itself folds into silver ribbons
far below, oceans of ash pulse with dim light
around her, echoes of lost worlds shimmer and fade
ahead, bridges of bone stretch toward a hollow sun
between the clouds, phantom cities flicker and vanish
beyond reach, stars unravel like threads of smoke
across the void, distant monoliths hum with forgotten energy
just over the ridge, shadows crawl across molten ground
past the ruins, spectral figures drift in looping patterns
from afar, the remnants of civilizations orbit endlessly
through the veil, luminous symbols burn and reform
underfoot, reflected constellations ripple across black glass
beyond the horizon, colors collapse into pure sound
in the distance, a frozen sea reflects the glow of dying stars
beyond her, cathedral-sized roots coil around broken towers
far below, a clockwork city ticks beneath layers of dust
on the horizon, a storm of feathers drifts across the void
behind her, the sky fractures into shifting panels of memory
through the haze, an endless bridge winds through skeletal forests
far away, glass mountains hum with invisible resonance
above, inverted oceans ripple with slow thunder
beneath her, ancient machinery stirs with hollow rhythm
beyond the ruins, serpentine rivers gleam with liquid light
at the edge of sight, floating gardens collapse into mist
across the valley, crystalline beasts wander in silence
in the far distance, a giant eye opens within a nebula
beyond the ridge, luminous vines crawl over forgotten monuments
far below, molten lakes cast long shadows on metallic plains
behind her, spectral banners ripple where armies once stood
on the horizon, the sun divides into mirrored twins
through the fog, enormous gears turn within fractured space
past the mountains, an aurora bleeds into the ocean
above, cities of light spiral endlessly through twilight
in the distance, a village sinks halfway into the marsh
beyond her, telephone poles lean through rolling fog
far below, rusted train cars rest on broken tracks
on the horizon, fields of wheat sway under stormlight
behind her, cracked asphalt fades into tall grass
through the haze, collapsed bridges trace the river’s path
far away, windmills turn lazily among empty hills
above, storm clouds gather, heavy and unhurried
beneath her, puddles reflect the orange glow of lamps
beyond the ridge, a radio tower blinks through the rain
at the edge of sight, rooftops poke from shallow water
across the plain, dust drifts around abandoned machinery
in the far distance, headlights move like ghosts along a ruined road
behind her, barbed wire fences cut through the mist
far below, a canyon breathes with slow curling fog
through the trees, the ruins of a factory crumble into moss
beyond the fields, chimneys exhale faint columns of smoke
at the horizon, wind carries fragments of torn banners
underfoot, gravel crunches as the light begins to fade
behind her, the old highway disappears into a forest of silence
in the distance, will-o’-wisps drift above the moor  
beyond her, a stone circle glows faintly beneath the mist  
far below, a river winds past cottages long abandoned  
on the horizon, antlered shapes move between the trees  
behind her, smoke rises from a hearth that should be cold  
through the haze, straw effigies sway from crooked poles  
far away, a thatched chapel leans toward the forest edge  
above, blackbirds scatter as if warned by unseen hands  
beneath her, the earth hums with a low, steady rhythm  
beyond the fields, lanterns swing on the path to nowhere  
at the edge of sight, pale figures gather where the reeds grow thick  
across the valley, bells chime though no one pulls the rope  
in the far distance, a harvest pyre burns without consuming  
behind her, the woods whisper her name in broken cadence  
far below, an ancient well breathes a sigh of damp air  
through the fog, a herd of deer stands perfectly still  
beyond the ridge, candles flicker inside hollowed gourds  
at the horizon, a crimson dawn creeps across moss-covered stones  
underfoot, dry leaves crackle like distant laughter  
behind her, a path of lanterns fades one by one into dark
