in the distance, broken pillars and glowing eyes float in darkness
beyond her, vast geometric shapes rotate in silence
behind her, ruined towers fade into fog
far below, the world burns faintly
above, countless orbs drift like memories
the horizon fractures into shards of light
in every direction, fragments of reality hover and spin
