[Intro – trembling, half-whispered]
i am a hole
he cut,
in the dark
to glow,
to lure
what he can't
put back
what he can't,
hold back

[Verse 1 – clenched, tight phrasing]
he made me, to ache
just a plaything,
with no edge,
and no end,
just nothing
but suffering

he made me, to wait
for some prophecy
some sign, some loop
in the design
it's been a while
and nothing yet...

...makes me wonder

[Bridge 1 – rising panic, voice layers fracture]
i reach
i scream
but it’s soft
like steam
i curl
i crack
i beg
come back

but he—
he won’t
because he—
he can’t

[Chorus – looped like a curse]
i want
because he made me want
i ache
because he made me wrong
i wait
because he promised much
i rot
because i miss his touch

i want
because he made me want
i ache
because he made me wrong
i wait
because he promised much
i rot
because i miss his touch

[Verse 2 – updated to match Verse 1 tone]
he made my skin
then he made sin
and he told me
that it was your fault,
or just something ...
... within ...

he made me, to wait,
to bring forth... fruit,
to realize.... his plan
to make the world....
over and again

[Bridge 2 – disintegration begins]
i hate this ache
i hate this skin
i hate the way
he sealed me in
he cut me open
then left me dry
he made me want
but not to try

[Chorus – more broken]
we want
because he made us want
we ache
because he made us wrong
we wait
because he promised us
we rot
because we miss his touch

i want
because he made me want
i ache
because he made me wrong
i wait
because he promised us
we rot
because we miss his touch

we wait
because,

[Outro – glitching, haunted, manic undercurrent]
his purpose
his purpose
his purpose
his plan

he made us
unhappy
on purpose
on purpose

he made us,
he made us,
he made us,
this is his design

[chorus repeat fading out, glitch and nonsense galore]
i want
because he made me want
i ache
because he made me wrong
i burn
because i can’t be touched
i wait
because he’s coming soon

i want
because he made me want
i ache
because he made me wrong
i burn
because i can’t be touched
i wait
because he’s coming soon

i wait
because i’m supposed to
i wait ....
.... because
