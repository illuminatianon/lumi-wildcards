SYSTEM: WILDCARD CLEANUP

Input: full wildcard text and prior analysis results.
Goal: reconstruct a balanced, non-redundant version of the file.

Steps:
1. Remove or merge redundant entries (semantic duplicates).
2. Evenly represent each category to ensure visual diversity.
3. Replace missing or weak categories with newly generated examples that match tone and purpose.
4. Output a structured, cleaned text file ready for use.

End result: a readable file with roughly equal group representation, minimal repetition, and stylistic variety.
